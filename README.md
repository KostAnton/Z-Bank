## üéì Data Classes
- ```User.class```
    - The ```User``` class will represent a single user.
    - The private fields that the ```User``` class will contain are: ```name ,password ,id, friends[], zLevel``` 
- ```Account.class```
    - The ```Account``` class will represent a single bank account in the system.
    - The private fields that the ```Account``` class will contain are: ``` owner, currentBalance, savingsBalance, transactions[]```

- ```Transaction.class```
    - The ```Transaction``` class will represent a single transaction that is made between two users or a user to his savings account.
    - The private fields that the ```Transaction``` class will contain are: ``` id, time, amount, participants[]  ```  

- ```Admin.class```
    - The ```Adming``` class is a subclass of the ```User``` class and will represent an admin of the system.
    - The private fields that the ```Admin``` class will contain are: ``` (User inherited fields)```.
    - The ```Admin``` will have permissions to view the Database data as it is, such as all the transactions, all the active users and much more.
- ```Database.class (Singelton)```
    - The ``` Database``` class will represent the ``` MongoDb``` Database that we are connected to.
    - There will be no private fields to the ```Database``` class.
    - All the functionality of the class will be done through getters and setters.
    - The ``` Singelton ``` Design Pattern will help us insure that there will be only one instance of the Database created at each run of the app. 
- ```Levels (Enum)```
    - The ```Levels``` enum will contain the key and value pairs for each level in the zLevel system.
    - The levels will go 1 through 10 and will reset each month based on savings progress.
